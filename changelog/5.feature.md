- Added [cmipcite.citations.get][] to provide a Python API which closely mirrors the command-line `cmipcite get` command ([cmipcite.citations.get_citations][] is a lower-level function which provides more flexibility to Python users looking for greater control)
- Added the [cmipcite.tracking_id][] module to support handling of tracking IDs specifically (as opposed to PIDs)

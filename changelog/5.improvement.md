- Added support for getting citations for files that are members of multiple datasets i.e. associated with multiple PIDs
- Added the `--multi-dataset-handling` and `--handle-server-url` arguments to the `cmipcite get` CLI to add the support above and avoid hard-coding the server URL used throughout
